# [GMail — Refresh External Accounts](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/gmail-refresh-external-accounts/)

This extremely simple Firefox automatically refreshes your POP3 external
accounts in GMail once a minute. It also causes the refresh button in your inbox
to refresh your external accounts.

## How do I use this?

Have GMail open in any tab. This extension works in the background.

## Privacy

The extension does not collect any data on you. All of your data stays between
you and your devices.

## Contributions welcome!

I'm developing this extension in my free time. Saying that, please report any
issues and feature requests here on GitHub, or send me pull requests, and I'll
try to get back to you as soon as possible!

Another way to contibute is to help with translations. Either by sending a pull
request with a new `messages.json` file as described in MDN's documentation on
[Internationalization](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Internationalization#Providing_localized_strings_in__locales),
or by using the
[Web Extension Translator](https://lusito.github.io/web-ext-translator?gh=https://github.com/danielrozenberg/gmail-refresh-external-accounts)
online tool and submitting the translation on GitHub with the (→) right arrow
button on the top.
